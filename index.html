      <p>Hi! I am excited to be in coding boot camp.  I currently teach English to second language learners at Wyatt Academy in 5-Points. Before that I was in Real Estate.  I wanted more structure and more consistent pay than I got in Real Estate, and I wanted more pay than I received as a teacher.  So I decided I needed a change of pace. Website development seems to be an excellent career right now, I like working at the computer, and I love building things. So, here I am!</a></p>
