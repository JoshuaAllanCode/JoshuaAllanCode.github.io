			<p>Hi, thank you for considering me for employment.  I am new to coding, but I love it, am a fast learner, and I just love to build things. Web design is a perfect fit.</p>
			<p>Before I caught the programming bug, I was a Real Estate Agent.  I gained valuable work experience in technology, customer service, and  time management.  When I knew that I wanted to have a career change, I tried teaching.  I taught Middle School English for a year. Ultimately I decided this was not the path I wanted for the long term. However I took away valuable lessons in preperation, adaptation, a cooperation.</p>
			<p>I am sure I will be a valuable asset at your company because I have a strong work ethic and I take pride in my work; I have excellent communication skills: written, spoken and interpersonal; And, I am dependable, honest, and straightforward with co-workers. </p>
			<p>I have a wide breadth experience in coding languages, and I am conifident in my ability to learn new languages independentally and quickly as needed.  Currently I am studying to add depth to my knowledge by going back to basics: html, css, and javascript, trying to learn new frameworks and nuances that I didn't have time to take in during DU's bootcamp</p>
			<p>When I am not working, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, playing guitar, listening to music(I am starting to build quite a Vinyl collection), and doing anything outdoors: camping, skiing, hiking.</p>
